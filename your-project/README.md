## Project Description
I've chosen the game hangman because of the diversity you can put in the code.
One player need to guess the word of the hangman with a maximum of 8. 
Before use of this game you need to have the libary Random. (normally standard in Python)

## Rules
Rule 1: You need to guess the word before the end of the turns!
Rule 2: Decide who shall guess the word and how wants to play the hangman.
Rule 3: The word you search has a length of 4 to 8 characters
Rule 4: Player who needs to guess the word can say a letter of the alphabeth he/she thinks appears in the word.
Rule 5: If you guess a good letter, you 're a step closer to the answer if not you loose one turn and your closer to your end.
Rule 6: You win the game if you find the word before you don't have any turns left. (hangman)
Rule 7: You lose the game if you don't find the word and run out of turns. 

## Workflow
Step 1:  Brainstorming (Thinking about what I can create in 48 hours)
Step 2:  Make notes on paper how I see the game I need to create
Step 3:  Search information about the game (Hangman) on the internet. 
Step 4:  Write down some Pseudo-code to get started
Step 5:  Actual write code
Step 6:  Debug
Step 7:  Give the game to 2 real players
Step 8:  Check for writing errors
Step 9:  Keep debugging because a program is never finish! 
Step 10: Making an presentation for the launch of the game.  

## Organization
I used Trello to track down my process.
Trello is an online application or phone application you can use as a visualization for process. It are the sticky note of the 21th Century. 

I asked feedback of 2 non-programmers for playing my game.
Because something you need feedback to improve the code. Working together can reach you to a higher level. 

Repository: 
- .gitignore file
- .ReadMe file
- .hangmangame (actual program)
